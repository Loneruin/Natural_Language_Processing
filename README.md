The repo with instructions for Mini Project V

Welcome to your final mini-project of this bootcamp. We hope you will enjoy it. 

### Description

We will combine the skills we developed in the previous modules to identify duplicate questions in a dataset provided by Quora. This dataset  was labeled by human experts which is an expensive process. The model you will build will need to automatically identify and label duplicate questions.

We are going to need to build a classifier model to achieve this result..


### Data

The labeled dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19iWVGLBi7edqybybam56bt2Zy7vpf1Xc/view?usp=sharing).
